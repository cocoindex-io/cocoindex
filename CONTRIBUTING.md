# Contributing

Cocoindex uses GitHub issues to track bugs and manage feature requests.

* If you are a new contributor see: [Quick Start](#quick-start)

* If you have a fix or improvement for the good-first-issues, go ahead and create a pull request. 
  However, we recommend you to leave a comment on the issue like ***I'm working on it*** or ***Can I work on this issue?***.
  This is to avoid duplicating work.

* If you plan to do something more involved, first discuss your ideas
  on our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/zpA9S2DR7s).
  This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal
  of inspiration.

## Quick Start

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors on the same issue.

Please check the [`good-first-issues`](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label to find issues that are good for getting started. If you have questions about one of the issues, with or without the tag, please comment on them and one of the maintainers will clarify it. For a quicker response, contact us via[Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/zpA9S2DR7s).

All our issues are regularly tagged so that you can also filter down the issues involving the components you want to work on.

## Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the main branch and, if needed, rebase to the current main branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with main you may be asked to rebase your changes.

* Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment, or you can ask for a review on the Dicord channel [cocoindex discord](https://discord.com/invite/zpA9S2DR7s).

* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
