# Build text embedding and semantic search 
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/blob/main/examples/text_embedding/Text_Embedding.ipynb)


In this example, we will build a text embedding index and a semantic search flow based on local markdown files.

- We will ingest from a list of local files.
- For each file, perform chunking (Recursive Split) and then embeddings. 
- We will save the embeddings and the metadata in Postgres with PGVector.
- And then add a simpler query handler for semantic search.

## Prerequisite

[Install Postgres](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/installation#-install-postgres) if you don't have one.

## Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Setup:

```bash
python main.py cocoindex setup
```

Update index:

```bash
python main.py cocoindex update
```

Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## CocoInsight

I used CocoInsight (Free beta now) to troubleshoot the index generation and understand the data lineage of the pipeline. 
It just connects to your local CocoIndex server, with Zero pipeline data retention. Run following command to start CocoInsight:

```
python main.py cocoindex server -ci
```

Then open the CocoInsight UI at [https://cocoindex.io/cocoinsight](https://cocoindex.io/cocoinsight).
