# Data Types in CocoIndex

In CocoIndex, all data processed by the flow have a type determined when the flow is defined, before any actual data is processed at runtime.

This makes schema of data processed by CocoIndex clear, and easily determine the schema of your index.

## Data Types 

### Basic Types

This is the list of all basic types supported by CocoIndex:

| Type | Description |Type in Python | Original Type in Python |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Bytes | | `bytes` | `bytes` |
| Str | | `str` | `str` |
| Bool | | `bool` | `bool` |
| Int64 | | `int` | `int` |
| Float32 | | `cocoindex.typing.Float32` |`float` | 
| Float64 | |  `cocoindex.typing.Float64` |`float` |
| Range | | `cocoindex.typing.Range`  | `tuple[int, int]` |
| Uuid | | `uuid.UUId` | `uuid.UUID` |
| Date | | `datetime.date` | `datetime.date` |
| Time | | `datetime.time` | `datetime.time` |
| LocalDatetime | Date and time without timezone | `cocoindex.typing.LocalDateTime` | `datetime.datetime` |
| OffsetDatetime | Date and time with a timezone offset | `cocoindex.typing.OffsetDateTime` | `datetime.datetime` |
| Vector[*type*, *N*?] | |`Annotated[list[type], cocoindex.typing.Vector(dim=N)]` | `list[type]` | 
| Json | | `cocoindex.typing.Json` | Any type convertible to JSON by `json` package | 

For some types, CocoIndex Python SDK provides annotated types with finer granularity than Python's original type, e.g.
*   *Float32* and *Float64* for `float`, with different precision.
*   *LocalDateTime* and *OffsetDateTime* for `datetime.datetime`, with different timezone awareness.
*   *Vector* has dimension information.

When defining [custom functions](/docs/core/custom_function), use the specific types as type annotations for arguments and return values.
So CocoIndex will have information about the specific type.

### Struct Type

A Struct has a bunch of fields, each with a name and a type.

In Python, a Struct type is represented by a [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html),
and all fields must be annotated with a specific type. For example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    first_name: str
    last_name
    dob: datetime.date
```

### Table Types

A Table type models a collection of rows, each with multiple columns.
Each column of a table has a specific type.

We have two specific types of Table types: KTable and LTable.

#### KTable

KTable is a Table type whose first column serves as the key.
The row order of a KTable is not preserved.
Type of the first column (key column) must be a [key type](#key-types).

In Python, a KTable type is represented by `dict[K, V]`. 
The `V` should be a dataclass, representing the value fields of each row.
For example, you can use `dict[str, Person]` to represent a KTable, with 4 columns: key (Str), `first_name` (Str), `last_name` (Str), `dob` (Date).

Note that if you want to use a struct as the key, you need to annotate the struct with `@dataclass(frozen=True)`, so the values are immutable.
For example:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class PersonKey:
    id_kind: str
    id: str
```

Then you can use `dict[PersonKey, Person]` to represent a KTable keyed by `PersonKey`.


#### LTable

LTable is a Table type whose row order is preserved. LTable has no key column.

In Python, a LTable type is represented by `list[R]`, where `R` is a dataclass representing a row.
For example, you can use `list[Person]` to represent a LTable with 3 columns: `first_name` (Str), `last_name` (Str), `dob` (Date).

## Index Types

### Key Types

Currently, the following types are key types

- Bytes
- Str
- Bool
- Int64
- Range
- Uuid
- Date
- Struct with all fields being key types

### Vector Type

Users can create vector index on fields with `vector` types.
A vector index also needs to be configured with a similarity metric, and the index is only effective when this metric is used during retrieval.

Following metrics are supported:

| Metric Name | Description | Similarity Order |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| CosineSimilarity | [Cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) | Larger is more similar |
| L2Distance | [L2 distance (a.k.a. Euclidean distance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) | Smaller is more similar |
| InnerProduct | [Inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space) | Larger is more similar |
